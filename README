This is Android device profile stub for Telechips 8925 based CX01 HDMI mini-PC.
!!!!
!!!! Board configured for 8Gb device - BOARD_KERNEL_PAGESIZE := 8192
!!!! So command line to build image looks like mkbootimg --cmdline 'console=null' --kernel kernel --ramdisk ramdisk.cpio.gz --pagesize 8192 --base 0x80000000 -o recovery.img
!!!! Don't know how this config will behave with 4Gb devices

At current stage it allows to build CWM recovery from CM9 source tree.

The guide for porting CWM to new devices is published at http://www.koushikdutta.com/2010/10/porting-clockwork-recovery-to-new.html

Disclaimer:
    All operations performed with devices are responsibility of respective owners of their devices.
    I'm providing all things as is. The testing was performed only on my CX01(8G, 7/27 ROM) device and can't be considered as comprehencive.

Instruction to build CWM recovery from this git:
    1. Go to CM9 working directory root e.g. /home/alex/CM9
    2. Load device files to device/telechips/tcc8920st/ directory.
    3. Load build environment:
	. build/envsetup.sh
    4. Load device profile:
	lunch full_tcc8920st-eng
    5. Build recovery:
	. build/tools/device/makerecoveries.sh full_tcc8920st-eng
    6. Recovery partition image is out/target/product/tcc8920st/recovery.img

CWM recovery image can be loaded to device connected to PC and accessible via adb commands.
The helper scripts for loading recovery from Windows PC are located in recovery.wininstall directory in device profile.
    backup_recovery.cmd - backups recovery partition image from device to current directory
    install_recovery.cmd <recovery.img> - load recovery partition image to device
    boot_recovery.cmd - reboot device to recovery
USB leyboard works in recovery - use cursor keys + enter.
